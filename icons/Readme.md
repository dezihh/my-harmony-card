## Icons for Favorite Popup

You can use the provided icons for station logos or upload your own.

To begin, place the icons in a directory accessible by your browser. Typically, this directory is located at `~/www/`.

For better organization, itâ€™s recommended to create a subdirectory specifically for these icons (e.g., `/www/icons`) and place your icons there.

Next, verify that the icons are accessible via your browser. For example, you should be able to access `zdf.png` using the following URL:

``http://<your.home.assist.ip>:8125/local/icons/zdf.png``

If you can successfully view the icon in your browser, proceed with configuring your favorite icons in MyHarmony as described.

Enjoy!
