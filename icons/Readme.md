**Icons for favorite popup**

You can take these icons for station logos or take your own icons.

Please add them to a for the browser accessible directory. Normally this is `~/www/`

Best, create a directory for these icons (i.e. ``/www/icons``) and put the icons in there.

After that, please try to access them by browser. In this example you should able to reach the `` zdf.png`` via

``http://:8125/local/icons/zdf.png``

If this is working you can go on with configure favorite icons in MyHarmony, as described

Have fun!
